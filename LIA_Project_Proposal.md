# Project Proposal 
## Duckling Safety Pen
Our team came forth with this idea; a guarded pen for baby ducks. 
It will have tempeture sensors and a photosensor. It will have a heat lamp as an actuator. Sensors and actuators are connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. That is connected to the Raspberry Pi using the MQTT protocol over a and communicating through a Wireless Wifi Network.
